		<p>This dog was lost right? He was so lost that he wasn't sure where to go in order to stop being lost.
		    The dog was trying his best to stop being so lost but he couldn't help but continue to be lost.  Eventually
			The dog decided he was sick of being lost so he went to the lost dog store and bought a GPS. He used it to
			get less lost. He was then no longer lost. The End.</p>
