            There once was a lost dog in a big city. He ran away from home in excitement because he had just witnessed one of the greatest Super Bowl games in history. Left and right he ran, through countless intersections, but the more he ran the less he recognized. All he could see was televisions blaring highlights, including "The Catch", through department store windows. After running all night the lost dog sat exhausted in front of a massive stadium. As dawn started to break, a usually grouchy old man wearing a hoodie without sleeves stopped by to pick him up and brought him safely home. The puppy's name is now Tom.
