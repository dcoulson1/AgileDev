    <p>
      There was once a lost dog, well not so much a lost dog as he was a dog who ran away from his evil owner.
	  His owner was a so called software developer, but one day he overheard the owner talking about his "Centralized VCS" that
	  he had just started using at work. The dog knew better than the Owner, that the centralized VCS was a terrible idea,
	  he knew that one day the hard drive in that Centralized VCS would go kablooey. So he ran far far away to a magical land, were
	  software developers didn't have to rely on a centralized VCS that could fail at any minute. He went to the promiseland of Git and
	  Distributed VCS were no had to worry about losing millions of dollars due to a faulty drive, hallelujah to Git!
