    <p>I exited the internet cafe and headed down the street. I saw many interesting shops along the way but one in particular caught my eye, it was a large brick building. This buidling was off course a real-life time travel shop which allowed you to go on trips to any point in history. I couldn't resist as I trotted inside to take a look. The price was high but as a software developing dog I had plenty of money and proceeded to take a trip back to visit the dinosaurs.</p>
