    <h1>Dieter Frank</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, my dog belonged to a different family.</p>
    <p>The first family owned a hobby farm, where my dog was eating goats and chickens.</p>
    <p>They threw up an ad on craigslist when the father was too lazy to properly discipline and train their dog.</p>
    <p>My fiance and I had a pet ferret, and time to train the dog.</p>
    <p>Now our dog is reflexively submissive to our ferrets.</p>
    <p>Caesar Millan has great simple tips for training dogs.</p>
    <p>Our dog ocassionally catches rabbits and pigeons in the yard, but knows and respects the boundaries between our pack and wild animals.</p>
