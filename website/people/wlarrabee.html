    <h1>Wesley Larrabee</h1>
    <p>It's tough being a big dog lost in a big city with so much homework to do.  However, I was fortunate enough to find an internet cafe to complete my Agile Class assignment for 50 points.  I knew that Steve wouldn't accept being lost as a valid excuse for missing my homework.  Like Steve told me, I made sure to backup my project first before I inadvertently deleted everythign I've worked on because Git is evil.  The work was arduous with my big paws, but I persisted.  Before starting my work or submitting the assignment, I made sure to pull (fetch and merge) to avoid errors.  I began to garner weird looks from other patrons, so I then quckly ran away.</p>
