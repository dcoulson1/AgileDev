    <h1>Bradley Ritger</h1>
    <p>Sine I happen to be in the big city I decided to play a fun game I heard of; Hipster or Hobo. This is a game where you look at people, usuually funnily dress and try to decide if they are, you guessed it, a hipster or a hobo. I got a few right but the mast majority of the time I could not tell the difference between the two. When I go back home I will have to tell my family about the strange way people dress in the big city.</p>
