    <p>Once there was a dog who got lost in the city trying to find a job in barkeology.  This little
    trip he took turned into a real cat-tastrophe when, on one rainy day, the dog was on his way to an
    interview when a passing car hit a puddle along side the road.  The splash drenched the dog, and he
    barked out at the driver.  "What do you think I am a water spaniel".  The dog walked into a store
    to use the bathroom, and used a fan to dry off. So, like this story, every tail has to come to an end.</p>
