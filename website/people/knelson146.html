      The lost dog was running around, trying to remember where his home was.
      Dog got tired from running, so he decided to take a break by a trash can.
      As Dog was sitting by the trash can he began to get sad because he
      couldn't remember where his house was.  Almost as soon as Dog became sad,
      he realized that he could think like a human, which he was never capable
      of before. This made Dog very excited and he began wagging his tail
      uncontrollably. His mind began running through all of the possibilities
      that awaited a dog with the brain of a human. Dog pondered the many
      options before him and settled on becoming the dog overlord to rule all
      dogs. Then he got up, peed on the trash can and ran down the block.
